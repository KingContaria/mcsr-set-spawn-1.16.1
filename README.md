* Overrides player spawnpoint with specified coordinates 
* Configurable seed and coordinates in `/config/setspawn.properties`
* Coordinates are validated before overriding
* There is logging in F3, world loading screen, and in logs
* Works with multi using the global config file
* Versions for 1.15.2, 1.16.1, 1.16.5, and 1.17.1

## Usage

* Generate a world to generate the local and global config files
* You can edit the config any time (you don't have to restart MC)
* The mod will only be active if you're playing the same seed that is in the config
* Spawn will only be set if the coordinates are naturally rollable
